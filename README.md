# Hospital Database Management System (HDMS)

## Abstract

The purpose of the project entitled "HOSPITAL DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM" is to computerize the Front Office Management of the Hospital to develop software which is user-friendly, simple, fast, and cost-effective. It deals with the information of Patients, Doctors, and Staff. Traditionally, it was done manually. The main function of the system is to register and store the details and retrieve these details as and when required. It is also used to update and delete the existing data stored in the database. In short, it performs CRUD operations. The Hospital Database Management System can be accessed using a username and password. It is accessible either by an administrator or a receptionist.

## Objectives of the Project

The objective of this project is to let the students apply the programming knowledge into a real-world situation/problem and expose the students how programming skills help in developing good software.

- Write programs utilizing modern software tools.
- Apply object-oriented programming principles effectively when developing small to medium-sized projects.
- Write effective procedural code to solve small to medium-sized problems.
- Students will demonstrate a breadth of knowledge in computer science, as exemplified in the areas of systems, theory, and software development.
- Students will demonstrate the ability to conduct research or applied Informatics Practices Project, requiring writing and presentation skills which exemplify scholarly style in computer science.

## What is Database Management Software (DBMS)?

Database Management Software (DBMS) is used for storing, manipulating, and managing data, such as format, names of fields, and record and file structures in a database.

## Applications of Database Management Software

- Banks
- Airlines
- Academies
- Telecommunication
- Economics and Finance
- Sales and Marketing
- Engineering and Manufacturing
- Human Resources

## Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

The Systems Development Life Cycle is a project management technique that divides complex projects into smaller, more easily managed segments or phases.

## Output

The output of the Hospital Database Management System (HDMS) project includes:

- **Successful Connection Confirmation**: Upon execution of the program, the user will be notified if the Python application has successfully connected to the MySQL database.

- **User Authentication**: Users can log in to the HDMS by entering their username and password. Upon successful authentication, users can access the functionalities of the system.

- **Functionality Options**: After logging in, users are presented with various options to interact with the database, including:
  - Registering patient details
  - Registering doctor details
  - Registering staff details
  - Viewing patient, doctor, and staff details
  - Deleting and updating data from the database
  - Plotting data from the stored database

- **Data Visualization**: Users can choose to plot data stored in the database using different chart types such as line charts, scatter charts, bar charts, and horizontal bar charts.

- **Logout Option**: Users have the option to log out from the HDMS system when they have completed their tasks.

The project provides a user-friendly interface for managing hospital data efficiently, including patient information, doctor details, and staff records.
